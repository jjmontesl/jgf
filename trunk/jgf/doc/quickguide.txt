BEST PRACTICES / QUICK GUIDE

  - Put your additional logic functions in LogicStates, and use their lifecycle "load" to load 
    references. You can throw an UnsupportedOperationException if you try to warn you if you
    activate it by mistake. TODO: Provide a base BaseHelperLogic for this.
    
  - Don't place any functionality in the console. Instead, add functions to the console that
    call the appropriate functionality.
    
  - Input is part of the user interface, so it belongs to the View tree, and not to Logic.
  
  - Document how geometric controllers are considered part of the view, and thus
    updated by Views???????? Check!
