# Getting Started #

### 1 - Download JGF and run the test applications ###

Visit the [Download](DownloadingJGF.md) page and get yourself a copy of JGF. The Download page includes information about how to build JGF.

Run some examples to ensure everything works (also, examples are useful sources of configuration chunks, for you to cut and paste).

### 2 - Check the examples ###

  * [Tutorials and Examples](Examples.md)

Once you grasp the basics, you can use the base project and start your own application.

### 3 - Explore the Feature List ###

Knowing the existing components may save you time. The [Features](Features.md) page contains a list of what you can expect from JGF. Inspecting JGF component class hierarchy is also suggested.
