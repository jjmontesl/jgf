= Downloading JGF =

Currently JGF is still in an early stage of development. A pair of core functionality aspects are yet to be built. Also, deep changes should be expected in the API and configuration format.

The source code can be accessed following the instructions at:

[http://code.google.com/p/jgf/source/checkout http://code.google.com/p/jgf/source/checkout]

= Dependencies =

In order to use JGF, you will need to add libraries or a project dependency to the 'trunk' version of [http://www.jmonkeyengine.com JMonkeyEngine] (the underlying game engine). 

Other dependencies are included in the src/main/lib directory. Those need to be added to your Java classpath at compile time and runtime.
