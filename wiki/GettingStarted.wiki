= Getting Started =

First of all, please note that getting started with any development framework requires some effort, because you need to get used with "how things are done". We hope JGF is worth the effort and that you enjoy the results.

As JGF is written in Java, so you need to know some Java. Also, JGF uses the [http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/ jMonkeyEngine] 3D Engine, so you will end up being familiar with it too (if you are not already).

=== 1 - Explore the Feature List ===

It is important to know your framework features. Just knowing they exist may save you time. The [Features] page contains a list of what you can expect of JGF.

If you want to know more, you can also read about JGF structure in the [Overview] section.

=== 2 - Download JGF and run the test applications  ===

Visit the [DownloadingJGF Download] page and get yourself a copy of JGF. 

Run some examples to ensure everything works (also, examples are useful sources of configuration examples, for you to cut and paste).

=== 3 - Follow the tutorials or copy the base application and start coding! ===
