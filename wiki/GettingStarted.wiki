Getting started with any development framework requires some learning and testing. Follow this instructions to make it simple.

Remember that JGF is written in Java, so you need to know some Java. Also, JGF uses the [http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/ jMonkeyEngine] 3D Engine, so you will end up being familiar with it too (if you are not already).

== 1 - Read the JGF Overview  ==

The [Overview JGF Overview] will introduce you to JGF and to how JGF games "look like".

== 2 - Remember the Feature List ==

It is important to know your framework features. Just knowing they exist may save you time. The [Features] page contains a list of what you can expect of JGF.

== 3 - Download JGF and run the test applications  ==

Visit the [DownloadingJGF Download] page and get yourself a copy of JGF. 

Run some examples to ensure everything works (also, examples are useful sources of configuration examples, for you to cut and paste).

== 4 - Follow the tutorials or copy the base application and start coding! ==
