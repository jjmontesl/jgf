=== General ===

*Q:* What is the current state of development?

*A:* JGF is not yet ready for public usage. Major changes are expected to the API and several features are poorly implemented or missing.

*Q:* Is jMonkeyEngine the only game engine usable with JGF?

*A:* Currently it is. While writing implementations for other engines is _in theory_ possible, this is not a minor task. Currently jMonkeyEngine is the only engine supported by JGF. Note that JGF doesn't require a 3D engine, and is _in theory_ extensible to support 2D engines as well.
