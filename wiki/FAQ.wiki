== General ==

=== What is the current state of development? ===

JGF is not yet ready for public usage. Major changes are expected to the API and  several features are poorly implemented or missing.

=== Is jMonkeyEngine the only game engine usable with JGF ===

Currently it is. While writing implementations for other engines is _in theory_ possible, this is not a trivial task. Currently jMonkeyEngine is the only engine supported by JGF. Also, note that JGF itself doesn't require a 3D engine, and is _in theory_ extensible to support 2D engines as well.

== Logging ==

=== JME spatial classes like Node keep logging too much ===

The LoggigConfigService can filter particular loggers. Adding the following configuration at the beginning of a JGF configuration file will filter some common verbose loggers:

{{{
<!-- 
Logging configuration
 -->
<service id="logging" class="net.jgf.util.system.LoggingConfigService">
	<logger name="com.jme.scene.Node" level="WARN" />
	<logger name="com.jme.scene.Point" level="WARN" />
	<logger name="com.jme.scene.Line" level="WARN" />
	<logger name="net.jgf.loader.FileChainLoader" level="WARN" />				
</service>
}}}
