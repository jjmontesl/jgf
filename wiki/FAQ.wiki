*Q:* Is jMonkeyEngine the only game engine usable with JGF?

*A:* Currently yes. While writing implementations for other engines is _in theory_ possible, this is not a minor task. Currently jMonkeyEngine is the only engine supported by JGF. Note that JGF doesn't require a 3D engine, and is _in theory_ extensible to support 2D engines also.
