WISH LIST

- A SettingsManager that manages setting retrieval and writing to ftp/ssh/... (VFS could
  probably be used to do this really easily). 
- A helper system to map beans to settings, so complex structures (like complete GUI
  configuration) can be stored in a single setting. This helper system would ideally
  consider possible version changes of serialized beans.

- View with isometric/perspective viewer/editor splineeditor/coords/etc...

- A centralized settings / scores / screenshots system (Server Side) and services

- A console component that dumps console lines to the log
- A console component that dumps console lines to a certain file ()
- A component (should it be a console wrapper? I think no) that allows ssh access to the console.
- A console component that is able to retrieve and execute scripts from a central repository,
  given user and password (possibly https), game, (mod), and config name.
  
- Tool to convert all assets (i.e. before distribution) from command line, and maybe Ant task.

- Network layer recording and demo playback system.

- Game modding and version management, downloading and switching
